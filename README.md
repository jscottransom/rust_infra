# Distributed Infrastructure Practice Projects

This repository contains hands-on exercises to practice building distributed infrastructure systems using **Rust** and **Go**. These small projects are meant to enforce core concepts such as messaging, concurrency, file safety, and network communication in a distributed context.

## üì¶ Project List

### ü¶Ä Rust Projects

#### 1. UDP Heartbeat System
- **Goal**: Build a UDP client that periodically sends JSON-encoded heartbeats to a central server.
- **Concepts**: JSON serialization (`serde`), UDP sockets with Tokio, message broadcasting.

#### 2. Concurrent TCP Log Aggregator
- **Goal**: Accept TCP connections and write each client's log lines to a shared file safely.
- **Concepts**: Tokio tasks, mutex synchronization, shared file access with `Arc<Mutex<_>>`, async file-safe writes.

#### 3. In-Memory KV Store with Message Passing
- **Goal**: Build an actor-based key-value store where clients set/get values via TCP or channels.
- **Concepts**: Message-passing patterns, shared mutable state, command parsing.


#### 4. Gossip Protocol Simulator
- **Goal**: Simulate peer-to-peer message spreading using a gossip protocol.
- **Concepts**: Random peer selection, periodic communication, topology awareness.


#### 5. Distributed File Writer
- **Goal**: Accept chunked data from multiple clients and write to specific parts of a file based on offsets.
- **Concepts**: File seeks, partial writes, chunked data protocols.

### üêπ Go Projects

#### 1. HTTP-Based Service Registry
- **Goal**: Build a minimal Consul-like registry where services can register and query others.
- **Concepts**: HTTP routing, maps for in-memory storage, TTLs for expiration.

#### 2. Pub/Sub Over TCP
- **Goal**: Implement a publisher-subscriber system where clients subscribe to topics and receive real-time messages.
- **Concepts**: Goroutines, channels, topic mapping, broadcast fan-out.

#### 3. Leader Election via Heartbeats
- **Goal**: Simulate multiple nodes and determine a leader based on liveness and priority.
- **Concepts**: Goroutines, timers, heartbeat messages, simple election algorithms.

#### 4. Fan-Out Metrics Collector
- **Goal**: Build a central collector that ingests metrics from edge nodes and logs them with timestamps.
- **Concepts**: TCP servers, batching, timestamp tagging, centralized ingestion.

#### 5. File Transfer Over TCP with Checksums
- **Goal**: Send files in chunks with integrity verification using checksums.
- **Concepts**: TCP streaming, hashing (SHA-256), chunking, reassembly.
